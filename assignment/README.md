<!-- How It Works:
Input Handling: -->

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator.
float() is used to handle decimal numbers.

<!-- Operation Check: -->

The program checks the operator provided and performs the corresponding operation.
If the user inputs an invalid operator, it displays an error message.

<!-- Division by Zero: -->

The program ensures that division by zero is handled gracefully by displaying an error message.
